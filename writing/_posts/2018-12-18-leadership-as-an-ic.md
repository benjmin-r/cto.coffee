# Leadership as an Individual Contributor
## How to lead if you're not a manager

In the time of empowered and maybe even self-organizing teams it feels like a given, that not only people in management
positions should be the ones taking on leadership. Heck, some teams and organizations even require their teams and
senior developers to "be leaders" without any kind of formal authority.

At the same time, it feels very difficult to nail down what leading means for people who are not enabled by an
organization's authority, such as a manager is.

So when I discovered the headline of [Tom Bartel's post "How to Exhibit Leadership as an Individual
Contributor"](https://www.tombartel.me/blog/exhibit-leadership-as-individual-contributor/) (via the always interesting
[SWLW](http://softwareleadweekly.com/issues/316)) it felt like "Finally someone answers this age-long question
succinctly" to me.

He lays down several behaviours, that in my opinion give very good guidance on how to lead without formal authority.
However, I find some crucial leadership aspects are missing from his list, which I try to describe now:

#### Make sure everyone is heard

#### Seek out differing opinions and solutions

don't just tolerate them in a discussion







Addendum

I know, there must be way more resources, be it books or blog posts, on this topic than only Tom's post. However the
most I could find until now, where more about explaining leadership in general, and not so much for individual
contributors in software/operations teams.

So I'd appreciate it a lot, if you [send other resources in this space my way on Twitter][@benjamin]
