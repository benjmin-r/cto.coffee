# Leadership as an Individual Contributor:

**Or: How to lead if you're not a manager**

In the time of empowered (and hopefully self-organizing) teams it feels like a given, that not only people in management
positions should be the ones taking on leadership. Heck, some teams and organizations even require their teams and
senior developers to "be leaders" without any kind of formal authority.

At the same time, it feels very difficult to nail down what leading means for people who are not enabled by an
organization's authority as managers usually are.

So when I discovered the headline of [Tom Bartel's post "How to Exhibit Leadership as an Individual
Contributor"][tombartel] (via the always interesting [SoftwareLeadWeekly][slw]) it felt like "Finally someone answers
this age-long question" to me.

Tom lays down several behaviours, that in my opinion give very good guidance on how to lead without formal authority.
However, I find some crucial leadership aspects are missing from his list, which I try to describe below.  
Note, that I'm not disagreeing with Tom, and some of my points are somehow already contained in his list of behaviours
that exhibit leadership. I'd like the below list to be understood more as additional points to Tom's list.


### Put your team and its deliveries first

"Software is a team sport" or as [Yulia said in the most recent cto.coffee episode][ep06]: "Coding is pre-dominantly a
social activity".

From this follows, that the output of a team as a whole is always more important than the output of a single individual,
no matter how experienced or productive they are. And as such, one can exhibit leadership, by putting their team's
output before their own.  
In more practical terms, one could say: Put aside your own coding or other work, if you feel that by helping, teaching
others the overall team output will increase

Or to put it differently: If you measure yourself by your team's output, not by your own output, you sure are on the right
track to show leadership.

This can sometimes mean, that it seems your own work is less recognized, because you do work, that's not as tangible as
code, such as onboarding documentation for new developers, a process description or a pair programming session with
peers on your team.


### Take ownership

This one is closely related and somehow a subset of "Put your team and its deliveries first", but still is important
enough to warrant standing on its own.

If you see challenges or problems in your team, be it in the way your team works or in the team's output itself, you can
demonstrate leadership by taking ownership and addressing the problems or challenges. Because often times it happens
that people see problems, but don't act on it. Acting on problems and challenges can take many forms, ranging from
raising the issue with your manager or in a retrospective and following up on it, to making the time to fix it yourself,
if you're able to.

Please be aware though, that not taking action on a problem you see, does not mean you're lazy or don't care or do not
take ownership. Reasons for not taking any action on challenges you perceive can stem from various, very valid reasons.
However if you have the head space, feel comfortable and have the means to address problems in your team, then in my
experience you're on the right path to demonstrating your ability to lead.


### Have an eye on the big picture

Often times, maybe except for very mature teams, some of a team's members slide into a kind of tunnel vision. Especially
individual contributors, who spend a large part, if not all, of their day deep down in the details of code, make this
tunnel vision their own. And while this may be a productive use of each of the team member's time, it may lead to
problems, if nobody is having an eye on the bigger picture of where the team is and should be heading.

If you can break out of this tunnel vision at times, and sort of check the current position your team is in with regards
to where it should be and should be going, then this can be really valuable for a team.

Bonus points, if you see a deviation between the current state and the wished-for state, and have concrete suggestions
on how to fix it. However, realizing there's a gap is more important than coming up with ways to fix it on your own.
More often than not it's good practice to involve your team in finding a solution, if only to avoid putting too much
effort into an idea, only to not see it supported by your team.


### Make sure everyone is heard

By now, it's a given, that diverse teams are not only the right thing to do, but also a [smart thing to
do][diverse-teams].

So in order to make the best out of your team, you should make sure to tap their knowledge and experience. After all,
what good does it do, if you have smart people on the team, only make all the decisions for them?

Still, recognizing the need for and having the intention of making the best of smart and diverse teams can get easily
caught up in all sorts of unconscious biases and habits. Which may lead to tapping into only a subset of your team's
capabilities.

A good first step to not get caught up in this and also a good chance for anyone on the team to show leadership, is to
make sure everyone, and I really mean everyone's opinion is heard if a matter is relevant to them. Especially in
team meetings, one can exhibit this kind of leadership trait by asking around before making a team decision.

Of course this does not mean, that everyone should have a say in every tiny decision someone else might make in their
day to day work. Rather leaders ensure that everyone whose affected by a decision has a say in a decision and is not
drowned out by other, louder members of the team.


### Seek out differing opinions and solutions

Somehow similar, but different, to the previous "Make sure everyone is heard", one can exhibit leadership by actively
seeking out opinions that are different from their own. These differing opinions don't necessarily have to be from
people on the same team, but can come from all sorts of places.

When seeking out and receiving these opinions, one should also not just tolerate them, but [listen to them
actively][active-listening], really consider them.

The goal of this is to make better informed decisions, based on more diverse opinions and viewpoints.


### Bonus: Lead by example

Diligent readers will notice, that [Tom's list][tombartel] already lists 'Leading by example', so you would not be wrong
to say, this is not an additional point to Tom's list.

Nonetheless, I feel this one is so important and also kind of a multiplier to all the above listed leadership traits,
that I need to list it too.

If you can show any of the above traits in a way that makes other people on your team want to behave in the same way,
then this is the strongest indicator, that you are a leader. Even more so if you don't have formal authority, which is
kind of the point of this list ðŸ˜‰


## Addendum

While the above list is based on my personal experience and observations, I wholeheartedly recommend the book "Manager's
Path" by [Camille Fournier][@skamille]. It goes well beyond what I describe and does so with way more eloquence and
depth.

Apart from this book I assume, there must be way more resources, be it books or blog posts, on this topic than only
Tom's post. However the most I could find until now, where more about explaining leadership in general, and not so much
for individual contributors in software/operations teams.

So I'd appreciate it a lot, if you [send other resources in this space my way on Twitter][@benjamin]


## Disclaimer

I'm aware that reality is messier and more complicated than the shiny, easy world of everyone being a leader. As such,
please don't understand the above list as any kind of checklist, one needs to fulfil in order to be recognized as a
leader. Rather please be aware, that some groups of people, such as underrepresented groups, may not show the listed
traits as easy as the typical white-male team member. If members of your team are part of an underrepresented group and
you don't perceive them as a leader, there might be other reasons at work, then them not being fit for leading.
