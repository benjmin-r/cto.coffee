cto.coffee is a podcast about people in technology. It features short conversation between [me](/work-with-me)
and varying guests, where we talk about the people side of technology and developing software.

If you like talking about the human side of technology, then I'd love to talk to you. Do [reach out](/contact/) and let's
have a chat.

And if you're interested in getting occasional (max. 1 per month) emails with updates from this site and what I'm
learning on my journey to become a better human and leader, subscribe to my newsletter.
