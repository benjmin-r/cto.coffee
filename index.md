title: "Let's talk about people & tech"
---

cto.coffee is a podcast series and a blog.

The podcast features short conversation between [me][benjamin] and varying guests, where we talk about the people side
of technology and developing software.

Contrary to the podcast, where you'll hear opinions from different people, my writing is mainly my thoughts and opinions
on people in tech. Namely all things leadership, management, how to collaborate effectively and how to foster empathetic
teams.
