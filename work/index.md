Hi ðŸ‘‹,  
my name is [Benjamin Reitzammer](about).

With over 20y of experience in the tech industry, from Developer through Engineering Manager to Startup CTO, and having
worked in a wide variety of companies and freelanced on many occasions, I'm
[nowadays](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7238803395048865792/) bootstrapping a business.


### ðŸª´ Founder Accelerator

Currently I build and run [Founder Accelerator](https://www.linkedin.com/company/founder-accelerator/).

Founder Accelerator is a business that helps founders, freelancers and solo-preneurs to not be alone anymore!  
And to take their business to whatever is the next level for them.  

Founder Accelerator does this by providing a 12-months program, where participants are coached by experienced
entrepreneurs and meet regularly with peers, who are in similar situations.  
This specific combination boosts confidence by letting participants repeatedly experience that others face very similar
challenges, and at the same receive practical advice and support from their peers and experienced coaches.


### Other Work

detailed account of the my work experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-reitzammer/), in case
you're interested in working with me.

Don't hesitate [to reach out to me](/contact) if you'd like to know more.


### My Values

All of my work is guided by the following beliefs:

**Value People**: People are not a resource. People are the foundation and pillars of every tech-related organization,
and therefore should be treated as such. With humanity, dignity, respect, empathy, openness, to enable strong
relationships rooted in trust and clear communication.

**High performance teams are built on human connection**: A myriad of factors go into enabling teams to be high
performing. That said, for me one of foundational factors that enables high performance, is the active nurturing of
human connection between all members of a team. Human connection enables better and deeper communication, and not the
least psychological safety.

**Everything is a system**: There are no silver bullets to any of your challenges, and most of the times also no
straightforward solution. No Agile is the same in any company, not one technology xyz can be the only answer to a team's
or organization's challenges.  Instead in order to overcome challenges, we must look at teams, their current solutions
and their challenges holistically, and improve them with clear, measurable experiments.

**Diversity, Equity & Inclusion cannot take a backseat**: Building diverse teams rooted in inclusive behaviours is not
only a sensible thing to do from a business point of view, it's the right thing to do.

If you don't subscribe to these beliefs with the same fervor as I do, then [we should definitely talk](/contact), as I'm
very interested to hear about the beliefs that guide your work.
