  I’m a generalist, with over 20 years experience of working in information technology.

  <br>
  <br>
  I've held most of the roles there are in a typical software development organisation.

However, over the last years I found that I'm most effective when I help an organisation grow in various ways, not only
in terms of size. Which, also, lead me to start [Founder
Accelerator](https://www.linkedin.com/company/founder-accelerator/).

When not collaborating and co-creating with people to make workplaces more effective and humane, I enjoy [cycling
long-ish distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/43411671), like to read ([ask me](/contact) about my latest read),
listen to music (my taste in music taste is ... eclectic, yet rooted in the 90s), like to
[draw](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7240298234517082114/), and love to spend time with my family
and travel with our caravan.

Things I've done in the past, but don't do anymore, yet they're still part of who I am:
- Help organise & run [SoCraTes](https://socrates-conference.de): in 2014 and 2015 I was the main organizer of the
    german edition of SoCraTes conference. Having had the fortune to be there at the very first SoCraTes in 2011 in
    Rückersbach, the conference and community has since been very dear to my heart, and a special time (almost) every
    year.
- [#humansconf](https://humansconf.org): In 2019 I started organizing a small (max. 80ppl) in-person conference, that
    was planned to take place in Germany. The goal was to give the humans/people-aspect of tech and the exchange about
    that a dedicated space. When the pandemic started, we switched to an online-only approach and [hosted two
    events](https://www.humansconf.org/events/) in 2020.
- Organized several local tech communities, including a [Coderetreat event series](https://x.com/coderetreatffm),
    [DevOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/devops-frankfurt/), a (now non-existant) Scala Meetup, and helped kickstart
    several other local tech communities.
