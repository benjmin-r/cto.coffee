  Iâ€™m a generalist, with over 20 years experience of working in information technology.

  <br>
  <br>
  I've held most of the roles there are in a typical software development organisation, and I still code.

However, over the last years I found that I'm most effective when I help an organisation grow in various ways, not only
in terms of size.

When not collaborating and co-creating with people to make workplaces more effective and humane, I enjoy hanging out with my family,
[riding my Gravel Bike](https://www.strava.com/athletes/43411671), [organise #humansconf](https://humansconf.org), [like to read](https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/1251133303131963395/photo/1), [sometimes make music or DJ](https://github.com/benjmin-r/music) and love to hang out in our garden.
