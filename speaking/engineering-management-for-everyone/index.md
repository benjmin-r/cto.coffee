- [DevOps Meetup Stuttgart](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/devops-stuttgart/events/259990682/), Germany
  on 04-Apr-2019


### Abstract

Everybody has a manager, if they like it or not, if they actually work with them or not. Still, when reading typical IT
focused web- or news sites there seems to be a somewhat common view, that managers are overhead at best and a hindrance
at worst.

Based on my own experience, on the multiple occasions where I had to work with managers whom I felt did not manage
(pun-intended) to support me and my team's work, I understand this view.
However, having been a manager for several different teams in the past, I feel this view is throwing the baby out with
the bath water.

That's why I want to show there is, actually a lot of, value in engineering management. I will do this by giving an
overview of whatâ€™s considered to be part of an engineering manager's job today. Be it proper 1on1-meetings, providing
transparency into and context for a team's work or constructive and actionable feedback. I will also include what
everyone on a team can do, to have a good foundation for a functional relationship with their managers. Because
management is a two-way street.
