## About Being a Generalist with April Matias

This episode I spoke with[April Matias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amts/), a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer from Berlin. April has a background in arts and humanities, worked in quality assurance for several years and has recently taken a developer Bootcamp to expand her knowledge and skills.

We talked about what a QA person does at a startup, their value proposition, where they fit into the company, and how learning development skills can help you to fit in and make your goal more scalable.

My Favorite quote from our conversation occurs at ~23min:
> Being aware that your own experience or own conception of someone else'ss experience can not possibly represent your target audience.
