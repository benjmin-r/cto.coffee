  In this episode I talked to Abadesi Osunsade, the CEO and founder of hustlecrew, and also the VP of global community and
  belonging at Brandwatch. We talk about all kinds of aspects of belonging in the workplace.

And right at the start, already at ~2min into the episode, Abadesi shares an excellent and to the point definition of
belonging and why it's important:


> A notion, a concept that's based on research that shows us, for people to really be productive at work and excel in
their roles and stay in your company and aspire to greater things in your organization, they have to feel like they
belong. they have to feel like they can show up to work, or Zoom in the pandemic, be their authentic self and not have
to hide any part of their identity. Whether that's a disability, having kids at home, being muslim, being a women,
whatever it might be. They want to be that person all the time at work, and feel comfortable and safe, that they can be
that person, that they as that person belong. Even if the CEO doesn't look like them or relate to them, or their line
manager doesn't look like them or relate to them, that's still ok. They can be themselves, they belong, they have equal
status in the team. And this is where this idea of belonging comes from. That's why this is something that so many
companies are putting resources into. They want to make sure that people feel like they belong, because they want to
make sure people can be super productive, and they also want to make sure that any diversity they have can be retained
and hopefully even grow.


Around 10min into our conversation Abadesi goes on to make the point of why it's necessary to see community as the
future of belonging:

> The value of taking a community driven approach [to belonging] is that it takes that burden of change away from the people who
already have less privileged.


At ~16min then Abadesi shares this truth-bomb on why equity is not enough, how equity can happen to not go far enough:

> So, the challenge with belonging is that you can make the most equitable processes across your whole company.
But if you are still behaving in a way that shows you have not really understood your privilege as well as bias and how
that works, then you could potentially not score well in terms of belonging.


Only, to right after that, share the very practical advice to use the frameworks we have in tech for building products
when working to increase belonging.

> We already understand, we know how to build products. We know how to build a product roadmap. We know how to split
tasks across a team, set milestones, set deadlines. We know how to set KPIs. We know how to like make assumptions.
Validate those assumptions with the data that we measure, decide what to keep working on, what to abandon, what to
reiterate. All of these frameworks are just as valuable for creating a culture with more belonging or community with more
belonging. And so the first thing I'd say is, imagine that this conversation was not about how can I increase
belonging, but imagine it was about how can I increase revenue. Or [...] how can I reduce customer complaints? What
would you do to, to understand the next best step? You look at the data, wouldn't you, right? Like if I wanted to
understand how to gain more customers for my product, I talk to my customers.

I hope you'll learn as much as I did while listening to this episode.

Enjoy!
