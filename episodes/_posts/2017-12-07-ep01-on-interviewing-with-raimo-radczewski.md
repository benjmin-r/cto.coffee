# Episode 01
## "On interviewing" with Raimo Radczewski

This podcast in general, and this episode in particular, is not meant to provide a guide or how to do certain things. In
that sense, this first episode turned out exactly how I imagined the podcast.  
It's a relaxed chat between equals, on a topic that's related to technology but is actually completely about people
and how to shape our interactions to become more human.

I had the pleasure to work with Raimo for several years, and when it came to thinking about who might be a good fit for
the format of cto.coffee, Raimo was one of the first to come to my mind. And so it was again, a great pleasure to
interact with Raimo, and an honour to be able to talk to such an amazing human as Raimo.

That said, I hope you enjoy listening to our chat as we enjoyed having it.
