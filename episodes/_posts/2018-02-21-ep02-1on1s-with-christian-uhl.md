# Episode 02
## "On 1on1s" with Christian Uhl

_Note: This episode is in German._

1on1s, the practice of two people (usually a manager and their direct reports) meeting regularly for various
reasons, are one of the most powerful tools for managers.  
If people ask me, what's the one thing they should do when becoming a manager, I always answer "1on1s". Which of course
is a simplistic answer, but then again one that allows lots of productive unpackaging of what makes great management,
but you get my point.

I find the practice of 1on1s so important, I've written about [why I do 1on1s][1on1-purpose] and [how they can be
structured][1on1-structure] some time ago.

Funny enough, [Christian][@chrisuhl], who somehow started a [podcast][uhlsteinescherben] about his journey on becoming a
manager around the same time as [the first cto.coffee episode][ep01] and a fellow software crafter, mentioned those blog
posts in [one of his podcast episodes][uhlsteinescherben-1on1s] and he and his co-host said something along the lines of
_"it'd be cool if we'd make an episode with Benjamin about 1on1s"_.

So, given that I love talking about humaning in tech in cto.coffee it was a no-brainer, that I had to talk about 1on1s
with Christian.

So I hope you have as much fun and get as much out of our chat as we did while making it. If you've got questions or any
kind of feedback, do [contact me][contact].

Contrary to the [first cto.coffee episode][ep01] I'm more the talker in this episode with Christian and we recorded this
episode in **German**. Also it was cross-posted to [Christian's podcast][uhlsteinescherben-crosspost], so you might have
heard it before.
