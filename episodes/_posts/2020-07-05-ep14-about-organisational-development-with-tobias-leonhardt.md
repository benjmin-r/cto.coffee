  In this episode, I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiasleonhardt/">Tobias Leonhardt</a>. <br> Tobias helps organizations scale by coaching them to nurture trusting cultures and helping them establish scalable organizational models, where individuals are trusted with high autonomy.

In the beginning of our conversation, when asked if he describes himself as an organizational development coach, Tobias says about himself:

> Today I would say, it's evolving, it's not Org Developer anymore. [...] I learn so much more every day, about people and culture. And I don't have a title for it anymore. I think the work is about loving people and helping them to grow, and by this helping the organization to grow.

Later, around ~20min, we also touch on the different mechanics and social technologies that Tobias implements at companies:

> It's the process of following your tension, processing it. And you involve more and more people, which means you involve more and more perspectives [...] How something easily gets too big to be assessed by one mind, really via these technologies you can activate collective intelligence and multi perspectives looking on one proposal and to see if it can cause harm to your organization.

_Disclaimer:_ At the time of the recording, Tobias and I are working at the decision automation platform [BRYTER](https://bryter.io).
