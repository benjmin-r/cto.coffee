_~2min_ Origin of "First Team": In a business and management context the term is indeed usually attributed to Patrick Lencioni. Lencioni introduced this concept in his 2002 book "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team."
While Lencioni definitely popularized the term in business literature, it's possible the concept existed in some form prior to his work. However, his book is widely credited with bringing the "First Team" idea into mainstream management thinking.

The intro/outro music in the podcast was made with Sonic Pi from [this code][intro-music].
