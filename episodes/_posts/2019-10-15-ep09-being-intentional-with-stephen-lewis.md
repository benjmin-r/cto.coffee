# Episode 09
## Being Intentional with Stephen Lewis

In this episode, I spoke with [Stephen Lewis][twitter], CTO at Palatinate Tech at the time of the recording. While we
touch on a lot of topics, I think the main themes of our conversation are being intentional in your leadership, failing
and the multiple benefits you get by building a trusted network of peers.

Stephen shares strategies for attending events, stepping out of his comfort zone and forming relationships to peers, to
grow as a leader. We discuss how being open about your leadership struggles, not always painting a picture of
perfection, may help others boost their confidence and create a more inclusive environment around you. Stephen also
tells us how he explores writing as a way to be more self-aware and find a balance. We also discuss imperfection and
failure and incidentally share this, almost intimate, moment of failure.

Enjoy!
