# Episode 10
## Building Team Trust with Daniel Jilg

In this episode, I spoke with [Daniel Jilg][linkedin], a Freelance CTO and Developer. The main theme of our conversation was building team trust. Daniel shares his learnings and mistakes as a leader and CTO. We learn about his background of how he has grown from these learnings and used them to become a better leader.

We discuss not losing yourself in the technical parts of work and keeping in touch with the human side. 

Along these same lines, we  then discuss being willing to listen to your team, how to not be a bystander of bad workplace behaviours, speaking up when necessary, and becoming an ally. 

My favorite quote from what Daniel said occurs at ~13min:
> As white, cis men we are often unaware of the damage we're doing. So if you have someone on the team who is part of a minority in tech, then it's even more important that you educate yourself about their situation and try to empathize with them and be willing to listen about their experience in that regard.
