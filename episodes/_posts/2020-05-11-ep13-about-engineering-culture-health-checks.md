James feels passionate about Diversity & Inclusion because when he started out, he felt it was very challenging to enter the tech industry  without a university degree and still sees that attitude today. That's why nowadays he's 
helping people make their journey to break into the tech industry.

In that regard, in the beginning of our conversation, James shares some very interesting insights around how people who enter the tech industry via non-traditional routes, such as online courses or coding bootcamps, can make their skills and knowledge better understood when applying for jobs:

> If people hadn't gone to university they found it harder to showcase a body of work, when they started applying for jobs. So, I always say to people: One fully completed project that you've put a lot of time and effort into, as well as actively contributing to Open Source projects, is the best way to build that showcase of work that you can do.

We then talked about how [Monzo][monzo] implements health checks for keeping track of some teams' engineering culture. A simple yet effective system for ensuring happiness, teamwork and effectiveness within engineering teams:

> Certainly as a manager that's my priority, [in] building those trusting relationships with people. So, even if they didn't feel safe in talking to the team, they could come to me.

Another favorite quote from our conversation occurred when speaking about how they handle supporting teams during the pandemic around ~30min:

> We wouldn't want anyone to ever feel as though their parenting responsibilities weren't necessarily as important as their work responsibilities.
