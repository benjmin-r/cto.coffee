  In this episode I spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/joanna_mocko">Joanna Moćko-Łazarewicz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/isleoftesting">Beren Van Daele</a>, from <a href="https://isleof.it/">Isle of IT</a>, a human centric company rooted in the testing community in Europe. Beside consulting clients on how to move teams forward, Isle of IT also organizes events, such as the <a href="https://itmatters.pl/">ITMatters</a> conference series.

  Joanna shares a lot of their considerations around cultivating welcoming events, and it's pure joy to hear about her passion for inclusive events. So naturally, we talked a lot about creating and organizing inclusive events, and how the COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot of how we approach organizing events.

While talking about this we also touch shortly on [#humansconf][humansconf], which I planned to organize for end of May 2020, but which is now cancelled.

We find that organizing events is also a lot about leadership, and hear more about how leadership can look like in times of crisis, such as the current pandemic.

My first favorite quote from our conversation, comes from Beren and appears ~19min:

> Although everything seemed to be going right, I was feeling very anxious, I was mostly resting with myself, trying to cope with that, but it was difficult. So I shared this with the team.

After that he goes on to share a story, how it can be very important and helpful for leaders to be open about their feelings and their struggles, very much in the spirit of what [Alex Schladebeck][alex-twitter] describes when she talks about [empathic management in episode 8][episode8].

And this quote from Joanna, which occurs ~22min, also speaks to me from the heart:

> This is the moment, if you don't have the human centric approach, it's going to be really difficult for you to lead your team successfully.

The [ITMatters][itmatters] conference series started in 2019 in Poland. Take a look at the ["Burnout syndrome – addressing the elephant in the room" talk by Daria Dorda][itm-talk] which is from the 2019 event, to get a feeling for the topics discussed at ITMatters.
