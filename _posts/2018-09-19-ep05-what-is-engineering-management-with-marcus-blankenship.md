# Episode 05
## "What is Engineering Management" with Marcus Blankenship

Ever since I started working in management roles, I never had any kind of formal management training. I even find it
hard to define what management is, after almost 10 years in multiple teamlead and manager roles.

However, over the last 5+ years, I never really lost the impression, that the widespread understanding of what
management in the context of software teams (aka Engineering Management) is, changed drastically. On the one hand, this
might be a no-brainer, because the working mode of software teams has changed drastically over this period of times,
with such concepts as DevOps and Continuous Delivery, to name only two of the more prominent ones. And the practice of
management must adapt to such changes in it's environment.
On the other hand Agile has been around for a very long time now, and in some environments it helped shift a focus
towards the humans and their interactions that comprise software teams.
And most likely there are even more forces at work (generational changes anyone?) that all influence the change in how
management understands itself and how it's performed.

I'm very happy that Marcus Blankenship, long-time management and leadership coach, agreed to join me for a chat about
this topic, to discuss this change in Engineering Management, what this new or not-so-new kind of Engineering Management
is, what it's practices are and some opinions and pointers where it's coming from.
