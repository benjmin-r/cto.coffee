# Episode 03
## "Developer Relations & Community" with Felicitas Kugland

Welcome to the third episode of cto.coffee, the podcast about humaning in tech.

I'm very happy and excited that Felicitas Kugland joined me for a chat. Feli is a Principal Product Engineer at an
agency. And while that title sounds like you've heard it before at other companies, Feli and her employer are
interpreting that position in a very interesting way. Besides working on client projects, Feli's is effectively working
as a Developer Relations person, as one of the first in the company, and as such is also building the meaning of
Developer Relations for the company.

The topic is somehow very dear to me, because communities were and still are so important to my personal and
professional growth. Some where even life changing, such as attending my first Coderetreat and almost all of the
SoCraTes conferences.

In our chat Feli talks about her journey, what Developer Relations means to her and how her kind of Developer Relations
is a special kind, and most of all what community means for her. There's even a secret idea-cameo of
[ConferenceBuddy][confbuddy], when Feli tells us her secret trick on how to support people to participate in community
events and in effect open up to the communities around them.

And if you finally want to know that one secret about Feli and cakes, you really have to listen to this episode.

Enjoy!
