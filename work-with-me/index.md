  Hi ðŸ‘‹,
  <br>
  my name is Benjamin Reitzammer, I'm a Freelance CTO and Developer and I'm very much interested to get to know you.
  <br>
  <br>
  You're interested in working with me or simply want to know more than what is on this page?
  <a href="/contact">Don't hesitate to write me.</a>
</p>
<div style='clear: both;'></div>

### Me?

In case you want to know more about me, feel free to [have a look at this summary](about) I put together.

There's also an rough list of [work I've done in the past and recently](past-work).

### I help your tech team to grow

I can do that in the following ways:
- ðŸš€ Improve your [**recruiting**](past-work#recruiting) efforts and find candidates that can move the needle with you
- ðŸ’ª [**Mentor & train**](past-work#mentor--train) your (remote) team and managers, to become more effective
- ðŸ§  [**Coach**](past-work#coach) you, your managers and your team in working with and overcoming your current challenges with regards to digital product development

### Interested? Let's talk

Sounds like what you need? Then [write me a sentence or two](/contact) about your current challenges.

### My Values

The following beliefs underpin and guide all of my work:

**People first**: I believe that people are not a resource. People are the foundation and pillars of every
software-related organization, and therefore should be treated as such. With humanity, dignity, respect, empathy,
openness, to enable strong relationships rooted in trust and clear communication.

**Everything is a system**: From this belief follows, that there is no silver bullet and most of the times also no
straightforward solution to a challenge. No Agile is the same in any company, not one technology xyz can be the only
answer to a team's or company's challenges.  
Instead in order to overcome challenges, we must look at teams, their current solutions and their challenges holistically,
and improve them with clear, measurable experiments.

**Supporting & Serving People is the most effective way to lead**: In today's complex environments anybody who claims
to have all the information and therefore should make all decisions, is holding on to a very dangerous illusion. Instead
leaders should support and serve others around them and let authority reside with the information.

**Diversity & Inclusion cannot take a backseat**: Building diverse teams rooted in inclusive behaviours is not only a
sensible thing to do from a business point of view, it's the right thing to do.

If you don't subscribe to these beliefs with the same fervor as I do, then [we should definitely talk](/contact), as I'm very interested to hear about the beliefs that guide your work.

### Let's talk

Agree? Disagree? Go on, [write me a sentence](/contact) about what you think about all this.
