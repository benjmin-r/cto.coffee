### Who am I

Iâ€™m a generalist, with roughly 20 years experience of working in information technology. Starting out as a System-
Administrator-turned-Software-Developer, I moved to Engineering Management positions over time. Some of the last roles I
held include four years as CTO of Robo-Advisor Fintech [vaamo](https://www.vaamo.de), Teamlead in Marketing Agencies, Ruby on
Rails Developer in a SaaS company.

In all my roles I aim to foster empathetic teams with a culture of continuous improvement, personal growth and
leadership on all levels. I think itâ€™s imperative to work with diverse and cross-functional teams in increments, in
order to sustainably and continuously build relevant solutions.

Through my work in the software development community over the last years, organizing conferences and meetups, Iâ€™m
well-connected in the community and delivered talks and workshops in a wide range of events.


### A snapshot of work I've done in the past

- *Build effective engineering organizations*, that continuously delivers value to their clients, while continuously
  improving their practices and growing as people.
- Facilitating and *nurturing humane and empathetic team and company cultures*
- Help teams develop and *execute hiring and recruiting strategies* so that top-talent will knock on their door asking to come in.
- *Coach engineering managers* and teamleads with their various challenges, such as having difficult conversations with
  people from their team, managing in all directions, feeling overwhelmed by the breadth of responsibilities.
- Help teams *build empathetic and candid feedback cultures*
- Help teams adopt or *improve retrospective and blame-less debriefing meetings*, and make them an effective and integral
  part of their continuous improvement culture.
- *Team Debugging*: Analyse teams, their processes and technologies holistically, in order to help them find and remove
  bottlenecks, increase speed and throughput, and deliver with higher frequency.
- Support companies in adopting effective *remote-working practices*


### My Core Beliefs

If you don't necessarily subscribe to the following beliefs with the same fervor as I do, then [we should definitely
talk](/contact), as I'm very interested to hear about the beliefs that guide your work.

**People first**: I believe that people are not a resource. People are the foundation and pillars of every
software-related organization, and therefore should be treated as such. With humanity, dignity, respect, empathy,
openness, to enable strong relationships rooted in trust and clear communication.

**Everything is a system**: From this belief follows, that there is no silver bullet and most of the times also no
straightforward solution to a challenge. No Agile is the same in any company, not one technology xyz can be the only
answer to a team's or company's challenges.  
Instead in order to overcome challenges, we must look at teams, their current solutions and their challenges holistically,
and improve them with clear, measurable experiments.

**Supporting & Serving People is the most effective way to lead**: In today's complex environments anybody who claims
to have all the information and therefore should make all decisions, is holding on to a very dangerous illusion. Instead
leaders should support and serve others around them and let authority reside with the information.

**Diversity & Inclusion cannot take a backseat**: Building diverse teams rooted in inclusive behaviours is not only a
sensible thing to do from a business point of view, it's the right thing to do.

### Let's talk

You've read this far? Then go on, [write me a sentence](/contact) about what you think about all this.
