### Me?

In case you want to know more about me, feel free to [have a look at this summary](about) I put together, in where I lay out [my core beliefs](about#my-core-beliefs), that shape all the work I do.

There's also an rough list of [work I've done in the past and recently](past-work).

### I help your tech team to grow

I can do that in the following ways:
- ðŸš€ Improve your [**recruiting**](past-work#recruiting) efforts and find candidates that can move the needle with you
- ðŸ’ª [**Mentor & train**](past-work#mentor--train) your (remote) team and managers, to become more effective
- ðŸ§   [**Coach**](past-work#coach) you, your managers and your team in working with and overcoming your current challenges


### Interested? Let's talk

Sounds like what you need? Then [write me a sentence or two](/contact) about your current challenges.
