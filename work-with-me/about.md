### Who am I

I’m a generalist, with roughly 20 years experience of working in information technology. Starting out as a System-
Administrator-turned-Software-Developer, I moved to Engineering Management positions over time. Some of the last roles I
held include four years as CTO of Robo-Advisor Fintech [vaamo](https://www.vaamo.de), Teamlead in Marketing Agencies, Ruby on
Rails Developer in a SaaS company.

In all my roles I aim to foster empathetic teams with a culture of continuous improvement, personal growth and
leadership on all levels. I think it’s imperative to work with diverse and cross-functional teams in increments, in
order to sustainably and continuously build relevant solutions.

Through my work in the software development community over the last years, organizing conferences and meetups, I’m
well-connected in the community and delivered talks and workshops in a wide range of events.

### My Core Beliefs

If you don't necessarily subscribe to the following beliefs with the same fervor as I do, then [we should definitely
talk](/contact), as I'm very interested to hear about the beliefs that guide your work.

**People first**: I believe that people are not a resource. People are the foundation and pillars of every
software-related organization, and therefore should be treated as such. With humanity, dignity, respect, empathy,
openness, to enable strong relationships rooted in trust and clear communication.

**Everything is a system**: From this belief follows, that there is no silver bullet and most of the times also no
straightforward solution to a challenge. No Agile is the same in any company, not one technology xyz can be the only
answer to a team's or company's challenges.  
Instead in order to overcome challenges, we must look at teams, their current solutions and their challenges holistically,
and improve them with clear, measurable experiments.

**Supporting & Serving People is the most effective way to lead**: In today's complex environments anybody who claims
to have all the information and therefore should make all decisions, is holding on to a very dangerous illusion. Instead
leaders should support and serve others around them and let authority reside with the information.

**Diversity & Inclusion cannot take a backseat**: Building diverse teams rooted in inclusive behaviours is not only a
sensible thing to do from a business point of view, it's the right thing to do.

### Let's talk

Agree? Disagree? Go on, [write me a sentence](/contact) about what you think about all this.
