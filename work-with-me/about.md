### Who am I

I’m a generalist, with roughly 20 years experience of working in information technology. Starting out as a System-
Administrator-turned-Software-Developer, I moved to Engineering Management positions over time. Some of the last roles I
held include four years as CTO of Robo-Advisor Fintech [vaamo](https://www.vaamo.de), Teamlead in Marketing Agencies, Ruby on
Rails Developer in a SaaS company.

In all my roles I aim to foster empathetic teams with a culture of continuous improvement, personal growth and
leadership on all levels. I think it’s imperative to work with diverse and cross-functional teams in increments, in
order to sustainably and continuously build relevant solutions.

Through my work in the software development community over the last years, organizing conferences and meetups, I’m
well-connected in the community and delivered talks and workshops in a wide range of events.
